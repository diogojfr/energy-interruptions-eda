# What is a electric disturbance event?
In a general way, an electrical disturbance event can be described as a term to categorize problems associated with power interruptions, ranging from a loss of electrical service for a short period of time to major blackouts.

Various factors can cause power interruptions, including severe weather, human/vegetation interference near power lines, system operations, and even cyber attacks.
